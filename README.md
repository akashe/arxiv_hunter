Find relevant papers on arxiv.

Idea: Too many papers are posted on arxiv everyday. It has become hard to find relevant papers and even harder to find papers with good ideas and important contributions. The main idea is to use machine learning to facilitate research and reduce its overhead.

Usage: Given your idea or what you want to see or read about(in a sentence or a para), this repo will try to find the most relevant texts spread across different papers and maybe come up with a idea tree. 

v1: simple keyword search across papers.

Best possible end results:
1) It doesnt depend on classic metrics like number of citations, h-index of authors and exact keywords match.
2) It thinks in terms of ideas and concepts.
3) It gives me different ways of achieving the said idea or how things has been done till now.
4) Maybe it needs to learn from my behaviour. Which papers I found interesting, which were hoax. Something like off-policy learning.


Step 0: Can Boltzmann machines be used?
Step 1: create embedding specific to me
